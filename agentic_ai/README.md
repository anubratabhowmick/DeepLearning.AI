# Agentic AI Course

This folder contains the lab notebooks for DeepLearning.AI's Agentic AI course. Each notebook demonstrates how to combine LLM calls with tools, memory, and workflow orchestration so you can build reliable agents.

## Quickstart
```bash
conda create -n agentic-ai python=3.11
conda activate agentic-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

## Folder Contents
- `requirements.txt` – minimal dependencies for the notebooks.
- `*.ipynb` – hands-on labs that mirror the course modules (create tool abstractions, route tasks, plan/execute loops, and evaluate agents).

Follow the in-notebook instructions for module-specific guidance.
